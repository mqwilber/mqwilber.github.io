## Current Opportunities

1. I am currently recruiting a post-doctoral researcher in quantitative ecology.  A link to the job application can be found <a href="https://ut.taleo.net/careersection/ut_system/jobdetail.ftl?job=210000006Q">here</a>.  If you have any questions, please contact me at <a href="mwilber@utk.edu">mwilber@utk.edu</a>.

2. I am currently recruiting a graduate student at the PhD level that is interested in combining field work and mathematical modeling of disease dynamics. Two possible research opportunities for the graduate student to explore are i) how do seasonality and ecological interactions affect the reservoir potential of amphibian species infected with chytrid fungus? and ii) how does individual heterogeneity in amphibian movement shape the contribution of direct and indirect transmission to endemic pathogen persistence?  If these opportunities sound interesting to you, I encourage you to read some of the labs work to get a sense of what we do.
