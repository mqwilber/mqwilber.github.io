## Current Opportunities

<!-- 1. I am currently recruiting a post-doctoral researcher in quantitative ecology.  A link to the job application can be found <a href="https://ut.taleo.net/careersection/ut_system/jobdetail.ftl?job=210000006Q">here</a>.  If you have any questions, please contact me at <a href="mwilber@utk.edu">mwilber@utk.edu</a>.

2. I am currently recruiting a graduate student at the PhD level that is interested in combining field work and mathematical modeling of disease dynamics. Two possible research opportunities for the graduate student are i) how do seasonality and ecological interactions affect the reservoir potential of amphibian species infected with chytrid fungus? and ii) how does individual heterogeneity in amphibian movement shape the contribution of direct and indirect transmission to endemic pathogen persistence?  If these opportunities sound interesting to you, I encourage you to read some of the [lab's work](/publications/) to get a sense of what we do. If you have any questions, please contact me at <a href="mwilber@utk.edu">mwilber@utk.edu</a>. -->

## Prospective Graduate Students

I encourage you to read some of the [lab's work](/publications/) to get a sense of what we do.  I expect my graduate student's research to have some focus on quantitative aspects of disease ecology related to mathematical modeling.  However, I also encourage my students to explore field work and laboratory experiments to complement, motivate, and expand their modeling approaches.  While much of my previous work has focused on amphibian-parasite interactions, I am broadly interested in host-parasite dynamics and disease ecology more generally. I encourage interested students with research interests in disease ecology outside of amphibian-disease systems to contact me.

## Prospective Undergraduate Researchers

There are current research opportunities in the lab for undergraduate researchers interested in modeling disease dynamics in wildlife populations.  Please contact me telling me a bit about your background and your interest in wildlife disease ecology.

## Mentoring philosophy

As a graduate student (particularly a PhD student), you are training to become an independent scientist. At the conclusion of your PhD you should have the ability to pose, address, and answer well-defined research questions.  As your mentor, my role is to provide you with the academic, professional, and financial support to achieve this goal.

Here is what I expect from my graduate students

1. I expect all of my graduate students to treat other members of the lab, department, and community with kindness, inclusivity, and collegiality
1. I expect a solid work ethic and resilience in the face of failure and criticism. A PhD is hard work and, spoiler alter, you will "fail" and your work will be criticized. And that is OK! Failure and criticism is an important part of the scientific process and it makes our work better. I expect (and will help you toward) resilience and positivity in the face of failure.
1. I expect independent thinking. I want to hear your ideas and I want you to build confidence sharing those ideas with the broader scientific community.
1. I except you to take time for yourself. A PhD is hard work and requires substantial commitment. But no one does their best work with their nose to the grindstone 24-7.  Take time for you, and your science will thank you for it.

Here is what my graduate students can expect from me

1. I will treat you with respect.
1. I will treat your scientific ideas with respect. This does not mean that I will not question and critique your ideas (as I expect you to question and critique my ideas), but I will do so collegially and from a place of respect for you as a scientist.
1. I will provide timely feedback on research, writing, talks, and other professional activities.
1. I will meet with you at least once a week to discuss research, life, or whatever else is on your mind.
