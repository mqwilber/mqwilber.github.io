## Graduate Students

### Joe DeMarchi (PhD Student)

I am broadly interested in incorporating complex host-parasite interactions into our general understanding of infectious disease. In particular, my research will investigate host-parasite community dynamics specifically how host identity, communities and landscapes can shape disease outcomes. I hope to incorporate heterogeneity among species and landscapes in multi-host communities to predict areas of disease emergence

</figure>

Nicole is pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Microbiology with a minor in Chemistry. Nicole is interested in pathogen genomics and disease transmission. She particularly enjoys studying zoonotic diseases and how they spread between different host species. Nicole is working on a project to understand the effects of bird population dynamics on West Nile virus in mosquito populations of Maricopa County, AZ.


### Braden Spencer

Braden is pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Civil-Environmental Engineering. Braden is interested in modeling disease within amphibian populations, and how we can use these models, mathematics, and statistics to better understand disease spread through various species and climates. In 2019, Braden (along with Diego) received the prestigious Urdea Collaborative Research Award to study the effects of temperature on viral shedding rates in the *Ranavirus* system.


## Alumni

### Diego Olivo

Diego received his Bachelors of Science in Chemistry and Biology in May 2020. In 2019, Diego (along with Braden) earned the prestigious Urdea Collaborative Research Award to study the effects of temperature on viral shedding rates in the *Ranavirus* system. Now Diego is gaining experience in the job market before applying to graduate schools.
