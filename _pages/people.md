I am broadly interested in incorporating complex host-parasite interactions into our general understanding of infectious disease. In particular, my research will investigate host-parasite community dynamics specifically how host identity, communities and landscapes can shape disease outcomes. I hope to incorporate heterogeneity among species and landscapes in multi-host communities to predict areas of disease emergence

I have a BS in Biology from Olivet Nazarene University and an MS in Epidemiology from the University of Colorado. I worked for a couple of years as an epidemiologist at a hospital in Denver and later at the New Mexico Department of Health. For several years, I have been interested in shifting my career from public health to wildlife, focusing on disease ecology. In the summer of 2021, I had the pleasure of working on a statewide assessment of alligator snapping turtles with the University of Houston. Since then, I’ve been working as an assistant keeper at Zoo Knoxville. I am honored to be joining UT’s FWF Department and having the opportunity to study the fungal pathogen *Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis* (Bd) in amphibian species. My research will combine fieldwork and mathematical modeling to better understand the factors influencing long-term Bd persistence in amphibian species in eastern Tennessee.

</figure>

Nicole is pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Microbiology with a minor in Chemistry. Nicole is interested in pathogen genomics and disease transmission. She particularly enjoys studying zoonotic diseases and how they spread between different host species. Nicole is working on a project to understand the effects of bird population dynamics on West Nile virus in mosquito populations of Maricopa County, AZ.


### Braden Spencer

Braden is pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Civil-Environmental Engineering. Braden is interested in modeling disease within amphibian populations, and how we can use these models, mathematics, and statistics to better understand disease spread through various species and climates. In 2019, Braden (along with Diego) received the prestigious Urdea Collaborative Research Award to study the effects of temperature on viral shedding rates in the *Ranavirus* system.


## Alumni

### Diego Olivo

Diego received his Bachelors of Science in Chemistry and Biology in May 2020. In 2019, Diego (along with Braden) earned the prestigious Urdea Collaborative Research Award to study the effects of temperature on viral shedding rates in the *Ranavirus* system. Now Diego is gaining experience in the job market before applying to graduate schools.
