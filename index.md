Our lab explores what leads to hot hosts, hot species, and hotspots in wildlife disease systems. We combine laboratory experiments, field data, and mathematical models to examine how these different scales of disease "hotness" interact to affect pathogen invasion and persistence. The ultimate goal of our research is to improve our ability to predict and mitigate the negative impacts of pathogens on wildlife populations.

<!-- While our work spans multiple disease systems, a focal system of our lab is the disease chytridiomycosis and its individual, population, and community effects on amphibians.  Read
