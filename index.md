The ultimate goal of our research group is to improve our ability to predict and mitigate the negative impacts of pathogens on wildlife populations. To this end, we are interested in how hot hosts, hot species, and hotspots affect pathogen invasion and persistence. We combine novel statistical and mathematical modeling approaches with laboratory experiments and field data to identify how heterogeneity at the scale of the individual host to the landscape affects disease dynamics.  By unraveling the contributions of heterogeneity across biological scales, we seek to obtain actionable predictions through a mechanistic understanding of host-parasite interactions.  While our research spans a range of wildlife systems, we often address our research questions using amphibians and their parasites.

<!-- Our lab explores the causes and consequences of hot hosts, hot species, and hotspots in disease systems. We combine laboratory experiments, field data, and mathematical models to examine how these different scales of disease "hotness" interact to affect pathogen invasion and persistence. The ultimate goal of our research is to improve our ability to predict and mitigate the negative impacts of pathogens on wildlife populations. -->

<!-- We develop novel quantitative approaches that use commonly-collected disease surveillance to provide insight into who (e.g., individuals or species), where (e.g., habitat patches), and when (e.g., particular times over a year) is likely to be "hot" for disease transmission, providing important information on the mechanisms driving disease outbreaks.  While prediction is a key component of mitigating zoonotic threats, accurate prediction without mechanistic understanding severely limits our ability manage zoonotic threats.
