Our lab explores the ecological and epizoological factors that lead to hot hosts, hot species, and hotspots in wildlife disease systems. We combine laboratory experiments and field data with mathematical and statistical models to examine how these different scales of disease "hotness" interact to affect pathogen invasion and persistence. The ultimate goal of our research is to identify ecological or biological levers that we can pull to efficiently mitigate the negative impacts of pathogens on wildlife populations.

<!-- While our work spans multiple disease systems, a focal system of our lab is the disease chytridiomycosis and its individual, population, and community effects on amphibians.  Read
